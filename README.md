  <p>My name is Long Zhang. I am now a PhD student in computer science funded by [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](http://wasp-sweden.org/) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. My research interests include chaos engineering, self-healing software, and antifragile systems. Do you know that actually we can inject failures into a production system on purpose in order to improve the system's resilience? Take a look at GitHub repo [Royal Chaos](https://github.com/KTH/royal-chaos) if you feel interested!</p>
